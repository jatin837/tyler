Scanning / Lexing
Parsing(ability to compose larger expressions and statements out of smaller parts)
	flat sequence of tokens (IN)-->(OUT) a tree structure that mirrors the nested nature of the grammer(Parse tree / Abstract syntax tree), it also does syntax error reporting

Static analysis
`binding / resolution`
	for each identifier, find out where that name is defined and wire the two together(SCOPE)
	
---------------Tree Walk Interpreters-----------------------
	some programming languages begin executing code right after parsing it to an AST (with maybe a bit of static analysis applied). To run the program, the interpreter traverses the syntax tree one branch and leaf at a time, evaluating each node as it goes.
